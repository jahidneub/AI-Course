🎥 AI Course Video & Presentation Creation Process

This document describes the complete process of how I created the AI Course Video and Presentation, including the tools, steps, and resources used.

🧠 1. Idea Generation

The first step was to generate ideas and structure for the AI course video and presentation.
I used ChatGPT (by OpenAI) to brainstorm and outline the content, including:

The main AI course topics

Logical flow and sequence of lessons

Key points for each algorithm and visual style suggestions


Tool Used: ChatGPT

✍️ 2. Prompt Writing

After deciding on the topics, I used GeneratePromptAI to create professional and effective prompts for video generation.
This helped structure the narration and visuals according to each AI algorithm.

This tool generated high-quality prompts aligned with my course’s goals and made the script creation process much easier.

🎬 3. Video Creation

Once the prompts were ready, I used Steve.AI (by Animaker) to create the animated educational video.
This free online platform allows users to convert text scripts into professional-looking animated videos with AI-generated visuals and voiceovers.

Tool Used: Steve.AI / Animaker
Features Used:

Script-to-video automation

Animated scenes and transitions

🖼️ 4. Presentation Creation

After completing the video, I created a professional AI Course Presentation using Canva.
Canva is a free online design tool that provides templates for educational and animated slides.

Tool Used: Canva

Steps Followed:

1. Selected a modern, minimal presentation template.


2. Added all AI course topics with short bullet points.


3. Used visuals, icons, and animations to enhance understanding.


4. Maintained consistent color themes and typography for a professional look.
