v. ⚙️ How the Algorithm Works:

Each algorithm solves search or game problems in a unique way:

A*: Uses cost + heuristic to find shortest path.
AO*: Solves AND/OR graphs using best-first search.
Beam Search: Explores only top-k best nodes at each level.
Bidirectional Search: Simultaneously searches from start and goal.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes minimax by pruning irrelevant branches.
Minimax: Decision rule for minimizing the possible loss.
BFS: Explores level by level.
DFS: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.

vi. 🚀 Applications of these Algorithms:

A*: GPS Navigation, Pathfinding in Games
AO*: Problem solving in logic and knowledge bases
Beam Search: NLP tasks like machine translation
Bidirectional Search: Puzzle solving, networking
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Chess, Tic-tac-toe, AI Games
Minimax: Strategic AI in competitive games
BFS: Shortest path in unweighted graphs
DFS: Solving mazes, topological sorting

Each game demonstrates a real-world application of the respective algorithms.


viii. 📊 Time & Space Complexity:

Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Notes
A* Search	O(b^d)	O(b^d)	b = branching factor, d = depth of goal
AO* Search	Exponential (worst)	Exponential (worst)	Depends on graph structure
Beam Search	O(b * k)	O(b * k)	k = beam width
Bidirectional Search	O(b^(d/2))	O(b^(d/2))	Efficient when goal depth known
Alpha-Beta Pruning	O(b^d) / O(b^(d/2))	O(b * d)	Best-case with perfect pruning
Minimax Algorithm	O(b^d)	O(b * d)	b = branching factor, d = depth
Breadth-First Search (BFS)	O(b^d)	O(b^d)	Complete but memory intensive
Depth-First Search (DFS)	O(b^m)	O(b * m)	m = max depth
